# Metrics Definitions

## 1. Activation Rate
The percentage of users who reach the "Aha! Moment" within a specific window.
- **Formula**: `Count(Users with "campaign_create" event within 14 days of signup) / Count(Total Signups)`
- **Business Logic**: Measures the effectiveness of the onboarding flow.

## 2. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
The predictable total revenue generated by all active subscriptions in a given month.
- **Formula**: `Sum(Price of all Active Subscriptions in Month M)`
- **Adjustments**: Annual plans are normalized to monthly value (Price / 12).

## 3. Net MRR Movement
Breakdown of how MRR changes from month to month.
- **New MRR**: Revenue from new customers acquired in Month M.
- **Expansion MRR**: Additional revenue from existing customers upgrading plans.
- **Churned MRR**: Revenue lost from customers cancelling in Month M.
- **Net MRR**: `(New MRR + Expansion MRR) - Churned MRR`.

## 4. Customer Churn Rate (Monthly)
The rate at which customers cancel their subscriptions.
- **Formula**: `(Count of Users who Cancelled in Month M) / (Count of Active Users at Start of Month M)`

## 5. Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
The average revenue contribution of each active paid user.
- **Formula**: `Total MRR / Total Active Paid Users`

## 6. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
The total expected revenue from a single customer over their entire relationship.
- **Formula (Simplified)**: `ARPU / Monthly Churn Rate`
- **Formula (Cohort-Based)**: `Sum(Revenue from Cohort C over time) / Count(Users in Cohort C)`

## 7. Cohort Retention
Percentage of original users from a specific timeframe (Cohort) who remain active over subsequent months.
- **Formula**: `(Users from Cohort C active in Month M) / (Total Users in Cohort C)`

## 8. Funnel Conversion & Drop-off
Measures user progression through key stages.
- **Signup → Activate Drop-off**: `1 - (Activated Users / Total Signups)`
- **Activate → Paid Drop-off**: `1 - (Paid Users / Activated Users)`

## 9. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
Average cost to acquire one new customer.
- **Formula**: `Total Marketing Spend in Month M / New Customers Acquired in Month M`
- **Note**: Requires marketing_costs.csv data.

## 10. Reactivation Rate
Percentage of previously churned customers who return.
- **Formula**: `Count(Customers with multiple subscription records) / Total Customers`
- **Business Logic**: Identifies win-back effectiveness.
